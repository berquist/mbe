# MBE (many-body expansion)

[![build status](http://img.shields.io/travis/cclib/cclib/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/berquist/mbe)

Tools for generating many-body expansion expressions, and splitting apart molecular systems into appropriate fragments for MBE expressions.

## How to run

The best way to see how the code runs (and performs) is to look at `examples/timing.sh`.

### Testing

```
pytest -v
```
